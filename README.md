<div align="center"><h1>üå´Ô∏è Mist 1.16.5</h1></div>

Hybrid server software for Minecraft, allowing Forge mods and Bukkit plugins to run together. Rogue fork of **[Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist)**.

New builds can be downloaded from **[Releases](https://github.com/MinecraftMist/Mist/releases)** tab.

About
-
Mist covers areas not covered by Mohist, while \*hopefully\* maintaining high stability and performance. It is designed to be usable on production servers.

As of now, this fork contains a bunch of Paper patches/optimizations that **[were cut](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/commit/ebeabb2b11624d3a5308eb37c083a951662b5f3f)** from upstream due to "mod incompatibility", which is arguable.

We will continue implementing Paper stuff (and unique features, too). No promises and deadlines, though.
